# pyWhois43

This is a stand alone python whois implementation for port 43 traffic.

It is derived from:

  *  https://github.com/richardpenman/whois/blob/master/whois/whois.py.

It has been refactored it for python3 only.

I am looking to integrate the official whois servers as documented by the IANA root db and maintained in:

  * https://github.com/rfc1036/whois
  * https://github.com/rfc1036/whois/blob/next/new_gtlds_list
